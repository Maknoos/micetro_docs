Python modules
--------------

To use some of the scripting features and the DNS Policies feature of Men&Mice Central, certain Python modules need to be installed on the server:

``pip2.7 install requests jsonrpc toml``

If the system doesnâ€™t have pip installed, use ``yum install epel-release`` to add the repository, and ``yum install python-pip`` to install it.
