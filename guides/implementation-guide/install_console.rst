Management Console
==================

The Men&Mice Management Console is a Windows-based application and needs to be installed on a Windows machine, or through a Wine session on Linux.

Run the Men&Mice Management Console installer (with Administrative privileges). Once installed, launch the application:

Log in with the default credentials:

* username: ``administrator``
* password: ``administrator``

The “Server name” field requires the domain or the IPv4/v6 address of the server running the Men&Mice Central application. (This only needs to be defined once, and will autofill on subsequent logins.)
Successful login confirms that Men&Mice Central is running, connected to the database, and accessible for the Management Console.
