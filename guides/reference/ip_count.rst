License Management - Calculating IP Usage
-----------------------------------------

Connecting to Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As the administrators connect to the services and enable discovery, the tool reads the data coming in and begins calculating usage. It will then do a comparison with the keys provided at time of purchase and display the number of IPs in use to the number that is encoded in the keys. At times, the customer is not 100% sure of their IP count, so the number is negotiated (best effort) with the Sales team.  

.. note::
  M&M does not lock the tool in any way if the license count is exceeded. Sustaining services is our top priority.
