Adding a Cisco DHCP server
==========================

When adding a Cisco DHCP server, the following dialog box displays:

  :width: 60%
  :align: center

Type the **User name** and **Password** that should be used to access the server. This is the user name and password that is used when normally accessing the Cisco device from the command line prompt. If the server requires a separate password to enter privilege level 15, enter the required password in the **Enable Password** field. If you select the :guilabel:`Connect using Secure Shell (SSHv2)` checkbox, a secure connection will be used to access the server. If this checkbox is unchecked, the server will be accessed through a telnet connection.
