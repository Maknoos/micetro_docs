Effective access 
----------------

Administrator with access to managing users/groups in Micetro can check the effective access of a user or group based on the role(s) the user/group is assigned to.

1. Navigate to :menuselection:`Admin --> Configuration` in the web application.

2. Select :guilabel:`Users` or :guilabel:`Groups`, depending on whose access you want to check.

3. Select the user/group in the grid, and use the :guilabel:`Effective access` action from the top bar or the ellipsis menu.

   It shows all *enabled* permissions for the user/group.
