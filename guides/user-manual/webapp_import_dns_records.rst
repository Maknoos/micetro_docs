Import DNS Records
==================

Overview
--------

DNS Records can be imported in the Micetro Web Application. The action to import DNS Records is available from the Actions menu in the DNS zones list, that allows importing records to different zones at the same time.

The Import DNS Records action is also available from within a specific zone, which allows importing records to that zone only.
