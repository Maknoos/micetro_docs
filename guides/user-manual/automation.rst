Automation
**********
Automating your network infrastructure can help you streamline your workflow, save time, and increase efficiency. With Micetro, you have several automation options to choose from, including REST API, SOAP API, and JSON-RPC. These APIs allow you to seamlessly integrate Micetro with other platforms and carry out a vast array of automated operations.

You can also use Ansible for automation. With Ansible modules and plugins, you can connect to the Micetro API and create DNS, DHCP, and IPAM workflows.

Furthermore, Micetro offers a plugin (via the menandmice provider) that allows you to automate Micetro operations via Terraform.
