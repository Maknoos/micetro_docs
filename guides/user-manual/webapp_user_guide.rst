Using the Web Application
=========================

Installing the Web Application
------------------------------

Installing the Web Application for Micetro is straightforward: just follow the instructions in the :ref:`install-webapp` in the Implementation Guide.

.. note::
  The web application cannot be installed on the same server as the old web interface. It needs to be on a separate virtual host.

Logging in
----------

Server
  The hostname or IP address of the server running Men&Mice Central

Username
  The username you want to log in as

Password
  The password for the specified user

Log in with Single Sign-on
  You can use existing SSO to log in. Note that the checkbox is only visible when the web server supports SSO.  For more information see :ref:`webapp-sso`.

  .. note::
    If you're logged in through an SSO service, the *Change password* operation is disabled in the :menuselection:`User menu`.
