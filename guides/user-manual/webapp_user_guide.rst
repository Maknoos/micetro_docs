Using the Web Application
=========================

Installing the Web Application
------------------------------

Installing the Web Application for the Men & Mice Suite is straightforward: just follow the instructions on the Men & Mice Download page.

.. note::
  The web application cannot be installed on the same server as the old web interface. It needs to be on a separate virtual host.

Logging in
----------

Server:
  The hostname or IP address of the server running Men & Mice Central

Username: The username you want to log in as

Password: The password for the specified user

Log in with Single Sign-on: You can use existing SSO to log in. Note that the checkbox is only visible when the web server supports Single Sign on.  For more information see Configure Single Sign-On.
