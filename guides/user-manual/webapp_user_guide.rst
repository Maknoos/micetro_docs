Using Micetro
===============

The application is split into 5 main sections:

* **DNS**. On the :ref:`dns` page, you can create, delete, and edit DNS zones. Here you also manage DNS records within the DNS zones.
* **IPAM**. On the :ref:`ipam` page, you have the ability to perform various actions related to network and DHCP management, such as creating a new network range or DHCP scope, managing IP addresses within a network or DHCP scope and creating DHCP reserverations. You can also view related DNS data for IP addresses within a network and add DNS hosts for IP addresses.
* **Reports**. The :ref:`webapp-reporting` is activated with a separate license key and there you can create and save new reporting definitions, as well as schedule reports to be run at specific times.
* **Workflow**. The :ref:`webapp-workflows` requires a separate license key. The module allows you to submit ‘change requests’ for creating, modifying, or deleting DNS records.
* **Admin**. The Admin page is the workspace for system administrators where they manage Micetro.
