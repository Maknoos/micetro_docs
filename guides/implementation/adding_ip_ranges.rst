IP Address Ranges and Devices
*****************************

Once DHCP services have been added to Micetro, all the scopes from the DHCP servers will be visible in the interface on the **IPAM** page. The organization might also have a spreadsheet or a database with other IP address range (subnet) allocations and details on individual devices (IP addresses). This data can be manually entered in Micetro or more efficiently, imported in bulk.

You can import IPAM data to Micetro using the Web Interface. See :ref:`webapp-import-ipam-data`
