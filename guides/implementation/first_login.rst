First login
===========

After installing and starting the required components (PostgreSQL, Men&Mice Central, at least one Controller, and the Web Application) administrators must use the Management Console (Windows Client) to log in to and initialize the system.

The default credentials:

* username: ``administrator``
* password: ``administrator``

After logging in with the default administrator credentials, the system will prompt to change the administrator password.
