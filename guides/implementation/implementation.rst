This document is intended to help administrators to install and configure the Men&Mice Suite. It will help the administrators to identify strategic servers to install the Men&Mice components on, as they do not have to be installed on all DNS and DHCP servers in the managed environment.

.. note::
  All Men&Mice components can be installed on virtual machines.
