Raise log level for Central
===========================

After logging in to the :ref:`first-login`, navigate to :guilabel:`Tools --> System Settings --> Advanced`` and locate the log file settings. (You can use the :guilabel:`Quick Filter` to narrow the options.)

Define the logfile’s location (e.g. ``/var/mmsuite/mmcentral.log`` for Linux) and in ‘*Logging Level for Men&Mice Central*’ set the value to **5**.
