Setting UP Cloud Integrations
==============================

Prerequisites
-------------
For IP Address Management (IPAM), Micetro connects with the cloud service through Men&Mice Central, and for DNS management, the Men&Mice DNS controller is required. Before proceeding with any actions related to Micetro and its interaction with cloud services, two essential requirements must be met:

1. **DNS Controller Installation and Setup**:

* Ensure that the DNS controller is installed on the machine where Men&Mice Central is running.
* For instructions on installing DNS controllers, see :ref:`install-controllers`.

2. **Network Connectivity**:

* Verify that the machine running Men&Mice Central can establish a connection to the specific cloud instance.
* The connection should be established on port 443/TCP. This is a specific network port used for secure communication.
* For detailed networking requirements, see :ref:`firewall-ports`.


If you intend to add multiple AWS cloud accounts using a single set of credentials, see:ref:`aws-multi-account`.

Adding Cloud Services
----------------------

You must have permission to administer DNS to add a new service to Micetro.

**To start using a cloud service in Micetro**:

1.	On the **Admin** page, select :guilabel:`Service Management` in the upper-left corner.
2.	Select :guilabel:`Add Service`.
3.	Select the cloud provider you want to use, fill in the required information, and select :guilabel:`Add`.

4. The DNS service and any subnets defined will be displayed under DNS Services and IP Ranges, respectively.

Akamai Fast DNS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fill in the fields required to connect to Akamai Fast DNS:

â€¢	**Obtaining Access Credentials**: For information about how to create API Access Credentials for Micetro, see https://developer.akamai.com/introduction/Prov_Creds.html

.. warning:: 
  Akamai OPEN APIs are time sensitive! Ensure that the system your client runs on is synchronized to a Stratum 2 or better time source.

.. danger::
  If the time on the server running the DNS Remote differs significantly from Coordinated Universal Time, authentication will fail preventing access/updating of zones through Micetro.

.. _connect-azure:

Azure DNS
^^^^^^^^^
To successfully configure Central and the DNS Controller with Azure services, ensure the following requirements are met:

1.	**Connectivity to Azure Services**: Ensure that the machine hosting Central and the DNS Controller can establish connections to the following Azure service endpoints:

   *	https://management.azure.com
   *	https://login.microsoftonline.
   *	https://management.core.windows.net

2.	**Azure Service Principal**: Create an Azure service principal with the necessary permissions to manage Azure resources through Micetro. Grant the following built-in Azure roles at either the subscription level or specific resource groups that you intend to manage:

   *	DNS Zone Contributor
   *	Network Contributor

3.	**Service Principal Details**: You will need specific information about the Azure service principal, which includes the following:
   
   *	Tenant ID: This identifies the Azure AD tenant.
   *	Subscription ID: The unique identifier for your Azure subscription.
   *	Client ID (Application ID): The identifier for your service principal.
   *	Client Secret (Authentication Key): A secure key for authentication.

   Detailed instructions on how to create a service principal and retrieve these details can be found in the Azure documentation.

* For information about the minimum permissions required for integrating fully with Azure, see :ref:`cloud-minimum-permissions`.

.. Note::
   At present, configuring a proxy for connections to Azure services is not supported. 


.. _connect-aws:

Amazon Web Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* 	**Obtaining Access Credentials**: For information about how to create API Access Credentials for use by Micetro, see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html

* For information about how to add multiple AWS cloud accounts using single credentials, see: :ref:`aws-multi-account`.
* For information about the minimum permissions required for adding AWS accounts, see :ref:`cloud-minimum-permissions`.

Editing Cloud Services
-----------------------

**To edit the properties of a cloud service**:

1.	In the **Service Management** area, locate the service you want to edit.
2.	Double-click the service or select it, and then select :guilabel:`Edit service` on the :guilabel:`Action` menu.
3.	Make the necessary changes and select :guilabel:`Confirm`.

Removing Cloud Services
------------------------
.. warning::
  By removing the cloud service, the associated DNS service and the corresponding zones will be removed. Additionally, any subnets and cloud networks will also be removed.

**To remove a cloud service**:

1.	In the **Service Management** area, select the service you want to remove.
2.	On the :guilabel:`Action` menu, select :guilabel:`Remove DNS service`.


Removing Cloud Networks
------------------------

**To remove a cloud network**:

1. On the **IPAM** page, select the specific cloud network.
2. On the :guilabel:`Action` menu, select :guilabel:`Delete network`.
