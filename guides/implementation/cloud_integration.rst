Configuring Cloud Integrations
==============================
Micetro communicates with the cloud services through Men&Mice Central (IPAM) and the Men&Mice DNS controller (DNS).

Before continuing, make sure that:

   * The DNS controller is installed and set up on the machine running Men&Mice Central. For information about how to install DNS controllers, see :ref:`install-controllers`.

   * The machine running Central can connect to the specific cloud instance on port 443/TCP. For specific networking requirements, see :ref:`firewall-ports`.

If you intend to add multiple AWS cloud accounts using a single set of credentials, see:ref:`aws-multi-account`.

Adding Cloud Services
----------------------

You must have permission to administer DNS to add a new service to Micetro.

**To start using a cloud service in Micetro**:

1.	On the **Admin** page, select :guilabel:`Service Management` in the upper-left corner.
2.	Select :guilabel:`Add Service`.
3.	Select the cloud provider you want to use, fill in the required information, and select :guilabel:`Add`.

â€¢	**Obtaining Access Credentials**: For information about how to create API Access Credentials for Micetro, see https://developer.akamai.com/introduction/Prov_Creds.html

.. warning:: 
  Akamai OPEN APIs are time sensitive! Ensure that the system your client runs on is synchronized to a Stratum 2 or better time source.

.. danger::
  If the time on the server running the DNS Remote differs significantly from Coordinated Universal Time, authentication will fail preventing access/updating of zones through Micetro.

.. _connect-azure:

Azure DNS
^^^^^^^^^
To successfully configure Central and the DNS Controller with Azure services, ensure the following requirements are met:

1.	**Connectivity to Azure Services**: Ensure that the machine hosting Central and the DNS Controller can establish connections to the following Azure service endpoints:

   *	https://management.azure.com
   *	https://login.microsoftonline.
   *	https://management.core.windows.net

2.	**Azure Service Principal**: Create an Azure service principal with the necessary permissions to manage Azure resources through Micetro. Grant the following built-in Azure roles at either the subscription level or specific resource groups that you intend to manage:

   *	DNS Zone Contributor
   *	Network Contributor

3.	**Service Principal Details**: You will need specific information about the Azure service principal, which includes the following:
   
   *	Tenant ID: This identifies the Azure AD tenant.
   *	Subscription ID: The unique identifier for your Azure subscription.
   *	Client ID (Application ID): The identifier for your service principal.
   *	Client Secret (Authentication Key): A secure key for authentication.

   Detailed instructions on how to create a service principal and retrieve these details can be found in the Azure documentation.

Frequently Asked Questions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
*	Can I configure a proxy for the connection to Azure services?

   This feature is currently not available.

*	What are the minimum permissions required for Micetro to integrate fully with Azure?

   Below is a custom role definition that covers all the required permissions for DNS and IPAM. Please look at Azure documentation on how to create a custom role.
