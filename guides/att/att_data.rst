Structure of AT&T’s DNS data
============================

As you know, AT&T’s DNS data is different from standard DNS data, and is split into multiple include files.

In the Men&Mice Suite, the include files are made available in the DNS zone list view as a specific zone type called “Include”.
Selecting :guilabel:`Include` in the sidebar will show all include files in the zone list and allow for editing them directly as DNS zones.

Additionally, the include files are also available in the custom workflows, to help narrow down the selection of DNS records to manage.
