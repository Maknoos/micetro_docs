Overview
********

Men&Mice has created a number of custom workflows for AT&T for carrying out tasks highly specific to their environments and operations.
The workflows described below target a specific task, and use the :ref:`<requests>` mechanism for containing the DNS changes which are made for each Work Order (MOP).
